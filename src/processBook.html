    <h2>BACKGROUND & MOTIVATION.</h2><hr>
    <p>Our group is interested in visualizing live (weekly) traffic data within the NYC metro system in order to promote safe and socially distant travel. Using 
        turnstile entry and exit counts, we plan to visualize how busy each station tends to be throughout the day, and cross-reference this with community-level 
        COVID-19 data to estimate the risk of utilizing each NYC metro station.</p>
    <p>Although other visualizations do already exist for NYC metro usage, most focus on visualizing live train locations or travel at a city-wide level rather than station-specific safety metrics.</p>
    <p>These existing references have helped us to preliminarily explore the data before we create our own COVID-specific visualization:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This <a href="http://piratefsh.github.io/mta-maps/public/">animated visualization</a> shows that metro usage varies by location throughout an average day (2015).</li>
        <li><a href="http://arettines.com/MTA-Graphic/">Another visualization</a>  shows weekly turnstile patterns over an unspecified period of time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our visualization will differ by aggregating historical data over multiple periods of time (day, week, and year-to-date), while also displaying the current, most-recent 
        data on map markers. Furthermore, we will incorporate live NYC COVID-19 rates to make predictions about the social distancing risks of passing through each station. 
        These design additions and modifications can also be seen within our designs below.</p>

    <h2>PROJECT OBJECTIVES.</h2><hr>
    <p>As COVID-19 cases have been sharply increasing again in the US, people will need to pay more attention to their safety. However, general news updates only cover total case 
        counts per state or in the US in general, which does not provide enough insight for residents to assess their specific needs, especially regarding local travel.</p>
    <p>Based on the US’s initial 6-month encounter with COVID, we know that there will still be people who travel to and from work and other essential businesses. As such, we 
        want to help these individuals break down live metro data into more useful insights to encourage safer travel.</p>
    <p>Our project aims to provide a NYC metro station-specific and neighborhood-specific COVID risk visualization to help residents and Metro 
        officials monitor, analyze, and make decisions about transportation routes or necessary station closedowns.</p>

    <h2>DATA.</h2><hr>
    <p>Our metro data will come from official <a href="http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html">NYC MTA reports 
        on turnstile entry and exit counts</a>. 
        We will combine this data with <a href="https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/trends/percentpositive-by-modzcta.csv">NYC COVID cases by Modified Zip Code 
            Tabulation Areas</a> to get a detailed breakdown that we can overlay with metro stations.</p>

    <h2>DATA PROCESSING.</h2><hr>
    <p>We will need to process the incoming data to parse hourly statistics. We then will get rid of unnecessary fields to minimize the data size, as it 
        is currently too large to be included in our web app bundle. For some fields, we plan to calculate cumulative daily usages to best simplify our data. We will execute this cleanup 
        using Python and write to a different file as a single data source.</p>
    <p>To calculate COVID-19 risk statistics, we plan to use a simple statistical model developed and used by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01000-9/">Georgia Tech</a> to analyze crowd risks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Let p denote the probability that a randomly selected individual in a focal population is infected. Hence, the probability that each of n individuals is not infected must be (1 − p)^n 
            and by extension the probability that one (or more) individuals is infected must be 1 − (1 − p)^n; we define this as the event gathering risk."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>VISUALIZATION DESIGN.</h2><hr>
    <p>Our visualization will generally include a map of all NYC metro stations, with interaction available to view specific activity and COVID risk data.</p>
    
    <h3>INITIAL DESIGNS.</h3>
    <img alt="Initial Design 1" src="images/Sketch-David.png" width="750">
    <p>One visualization design incorporates a time slider to visualize both COVID data (via zip code overlays) and station activity data (via markers) over time. Users could 
        filter and simplify results based on metro line, and revenue estimates would allow government officials and the general population to view any spikes or dips in overall usage.
    </p><br>
    <img alt="Initial Design 2" src="images/Sketch-Ege.png" width="750">
    <p>A second design localizes COVID risks to color-coded station markers, and provides a detailed view of historic station activity throughout the day. This would allow users to 
        make informed decisions about their own future travel plans. A more detailed economic activity portion also includes the percentage of total passengers passing through each 
        station, providing a bigger-picture overview of station activity.</p><br>
    <img alt="Initial Design 3" src="images/Sketch-Isaac.png" width="750">
    <p>A third visualization design utilizes a metro map rather than a geographical map to display activity and COVID risk at each metro station, and provides easily-visible 
        activity and risk estimates. Utilizing a simple statistical equation provided by Georgia Tech (see <em>Data Processing</em>), users are also provided with specific COVID risk details
        for differing crowd-sizes.</p><br>
    <h3>FINAL DESIGN.</h3>
    <img alt="Final Design" src="images/Final-Design.png" width="750">
    <p>Our final design incorporates the best features of all of our preliminary designs. It includes a geographical map of stations, which will allow users to easily find stations near 
        their current location. Color-coded markers and map overlays will provide details about local COVID rates and live activity. Interaction with station markers will provide information about 
        hourly and daily traffic, allowing users to utilize less densely-populated travel times. A COVID-19 risk portion will provide detailed information about the risks of traveling through 
        each specific station. An year-to-date visualization will display economic and traffic distribution trends, providing a larger-scale overview of travel and economic ramifications of 
        the pandemic. Selecting multiple stations will display averages of the data, allowing users to test out different potential routes to find the safest option.</p>

    <h2>MUST-HAVE FEATURES.</h2><hr>
    <ul>
        <li>Our visualization must include NYC MTA stations on a map with color-coding based on usage and risk.</li>
        <li>Users must be able to view historical data trends, allowing for informed choices about travel timing.</li>
        <li>Our visualization must provide information about COVID-19 risks for each NYC metro station or geographic region.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>OPTIONAL FEATURES.</h2><hr>
    <ul>
        <li>Predictions of live metro usage based on the current time of viewing and historical trends.</li>
        <li>Average risk scores of entire metro lines or complex travel routes.</li>
        <li>Historical COVID-19 data, which would be interesting but might be less necessary for the purposes of our visualization. We will need to determine if this would either help or 
            over complicate our visualization.</li>
    </ul>
